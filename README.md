# Contensis JS Delivery API

## Introduction
The Delivery API is our primary API, designed and focused on enabling you to get content and data into your webpages or applications as quickly and easily as possible. The data consumed from this API is read-only and focused solely on content retrieval.

The API is a RESTful service to ensure maximum compatibility, delivering content as JSON and resource files (assets) as text or binary files. We currently provide .NET and JavaScript client API wrappers to simplify using the API and we will be delivering other language implementations in the future.
